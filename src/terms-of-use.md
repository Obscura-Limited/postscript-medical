The "Platform" is a patient education and communication tool designed to enhance interaction between medical professionals and their patients. The Platform is provided by PostScript Medical Limited, of 18 The Broadway East Lane, Wembley, Middlesex, England, HA9 8JU ("PostScript Medical"). By accepting these terms of use, you agree to be bound by them in relation to all use of the Platform.

## The Platform

We shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to make the Platform available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for routine and emergency maintenance.

From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Platform at our sole discretion.
